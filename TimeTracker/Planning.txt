Shift object - 2 DateTimes, calculate difference between the two

Pay Period, list of DateTimes, add up the hours & minutes. This class should have 
save/load functionality. 

Need to be able to add a date range, beginning date and ending date has to not be 
within other pay period date ranges already made

Next up, need to fix error messages for adding a shift, currently all errors display
at end of shift text box.Also, a pay period cannot have its dates adjusted as is.

Changing a pay period
 must remove shifts to proceed, use messagebox with options confirming choice

To update a pay period - Need to check if it would be acceptable to perform update,
  loop through list of payperiods. If transaction is selected transaction - continue
if pay period 

 

bool validUpdate(PayPeriod payPeriod,DateTime start, DateTime end)
bool validFlag = true
foreach PayPeriod listPayPeriod in List)
    if payperiod == listPayPeriod
         continue
    if start >= listPayPeriod.Start && start < listPayPeriod.End
        validFlag = false
    if end <= listPayPeriod.End && end > listPayPeriod.Start
        validFlag = false
return validFlag
